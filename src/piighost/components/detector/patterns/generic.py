"""Country-agnostic PII regex patterns.

These target PII whose syntax is not country-specific, such as email, URL,
IPv4, and credit card. Pass them to a RegexDetector. Patterns match on shape
alone, with no checksum validation, so a value mangled by OCR is kept rather
than dropped.

    # "@". The lookbehind pins a match to the start of a local-part run, so an
    # adversarial "a.a.a..." cannot restart the scan at every character, and the
    # domain is segmented label by label so "." is never both a class member and
    # a separator. Both guards keep the scan linear instead of quadratic. The
    # Latin letters with diacritics (U+00C0 to U+024F) belong to the local part
    # and the domain labels: without them "expéditeur@exemple.fr" matched from
    # "diteur", leaving "expé" in clear.
