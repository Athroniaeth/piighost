"""Country-agnostic PII regex patterns.

These target PII whose syntax is not country-specific, such as email, URL,
IPv4, and credit card. Pass them to a RegexDetector. Patterns match on shape
alone, with no checksum validation, so a value mangled by OCR is kept rather
than dropped.

GENERIC_PATTERNS: dict[str, str] = {
    # Simplified RFC 5322, tight enough to avoid matching everything with an
    # "@". The lookbehind pins a match to the start of a local-part run, so an
    # adversarial "a.a.a..." cannot restart the scan at every character, and the
    # domain is segmented label by label so "." is never both a class member and
    # a separator. Both guards keep the scan linear instead of quadratic. The
    # catalogs compile under re.ASCII, so the letter classes turn Unicode on
    # locally: a letter of any script belongs to the local part, the domain
    # labels and the top-level domain. With ASCII classes "expéditeur@exemple.fr"
    # matched from "diteur", leaving "expé" in clear.
